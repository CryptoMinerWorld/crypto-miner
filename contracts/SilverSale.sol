/**
 * @title Silver Box Sale
 *
 * @notice Silver Box Sale is responsible for selling Silver and Gold ERC20
 *      tokens to the players
 *
 * @notice Sale prices are not fixed and increase over time:
 *      the price goes up by 1.25% every 24 hours
 *
 * @notice The sale happens in strict time frame, it is impossible to buy a
 *      box before the sale starts and after it ends
 *
 * @notice Sale lasts for 20 days (480 hours)
 *
 * @notice Sell mechanism is implemented through the loot box mechanism:
 *      there are three kinds of boxes which can be bought:
 *        1. Silver Box
 *        2. Rotund Silver Box
 *        3. Goldish Silver Box
 * @notice Silver Box contains only silver, amount of silver in the box
 *      is randomized and varies in a range from 20 to 30 pieces
 * @notice Silver Box initial price is 0.096 ETH, final price is 0.12 ETH
 *
 * @notice Rotund Silver Box contains only silver, amount of silver in the box
 *      is randomized and varies in a range from 70 to 90 pieces
 * @notice Rotund Silver Box initial price is 0.32 ETH, final price is 0.4 ETH
 *
 * @notice Goldish Silver Box contains 100-200 pieces of silver,
 *      and in contrast to the silver box, it may also contain one gold piece
 * @notice Goldish Silver Box initial price is 0.76ETH, final price is 0.95 ETH
 *
 * @notice The chance of getting gold piece in Goldish Silver Box is 42%
 * @notice Goldish Silver Box with a piece of gold in it contains 100-120 pieces of silver,
 *      while the box without gold piece contains 150-200 pieces of silver
 *
 * @dev Sale start timestamp (offset) and sale duration (length) are set in
 *      the smart contract on deployment
 * @dev Sale is active during the time frame [offset, offset + length),
 *      where `offset` is a unix timestamp of the sale start and `length`
 *      is length of the sale in seconds
 * @dev Silver Sale acts as `ROLE_TOKEN_CREATOR` for both
 *    Silver (SilverERC20) and Gold (GoldERC20) ERC20 tokens
 * @dev All the random distributions used in sale are uniform
